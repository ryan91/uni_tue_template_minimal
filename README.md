## What this is

This is a reduced LaTeX class for simple documents where you don't need a load
of overhead and a ton of packages.

## How to use

You need to know how to include self- defined classes into your LaTeX- runtime-
environment. There are multiple ways to do this and they're well documented on
many web pages, so you just need to look them up.

If you did so, just use the commnd `\documentclass{utt_minimal}` at the
beginning of your document. Have fun!
